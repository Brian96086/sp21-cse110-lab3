Template for a typical standup meeting

What have been doing since yesterday/last meeting?
(Ex: I have been brainstorming and researching possible features of a typical bullet journal)

What will be working on from today till the next meeting?
(Ex: I will be doing more in-depth and detailed research as on highlight features as well as trying to think of ways to integrate into all of your current ideas)

What issues are blocking you?
(Ex: Some of the ideas are difficult to integrate to our current ideas. I will keep brainstorming and looking at other samples to get some inspirations on how we can accept maximum amount of our ideas harmonically)
