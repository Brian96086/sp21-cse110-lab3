            <h2 id="TwoDays"> Two Days Ago - Life is Hard but I still enjoy schoolwork?</h2>
            <p>
                Today isn't as stressed as I think. As a data science major trying to
                transfer to computer science, I took CSE101, CSE105, CSE110, and DSC80.
                I do receive a lot of hw deadlines, but I am not that overwhelmed right now
                probably because deadlines are still 4-5 days away from today. <br>No worries!
                Procrastination for Life!!!

            <p>
                This day is extremely tiring. The deadlines are chasing me and I do feel the sense of urgency
                to finish my hw. Moreover, there's 2 quizzes two days after(announced just now). I tried my best
                to procrastinate and calm myself down, but it just doesn't work. The more I procrastinate, the more
                nervous I am. I tell myself to start doing work, persuading myself through my bs
                <br> - Diamonds are made under pressure, <strong>starting your hw at the last moment gives you the best
                    productivity.</strong>

            <p>
                There's too much hw and quizzes to finish and review. Moreover, I have another meeting for another club,
                and
                I am responsible for typing out and brainstorming the meeting minutes. This is why I am still awake at 3
                am, doing
                this lab as well as finishing up meeting contents for 11 am meeting.

                <summary>Feeling after three day stress</summary>
                <p>I am indeed feeling stressful right now, but stress might be an indication for me
                    to confront problem instead of dodging it through procrastination. <br><strong>What doesn't
                        kill me makes me stronger</strong>, I am going to overcome this difficulty and develop more
                    resilience and internalize those knowledge

            <h2><i>Life is hard, but there are ways to make less painful. Be Happy!</i> </h2>
            <p> Although life is difficult, a person's attitude can alleviate his/her circumstance.
                Personally, I watch funny videos to entertain myself. I laugh at people who fell harder
                at me (I know i shouldn't laugh at them haha! ) </p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls="controls">

                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>
                I also listen to music when I am depressed or confronted by academic pressure. I listen to both
                mandarin songs and english songs. Below attached is one of the songs I've heard recently(It's in
                mandarin!).
            </p>

                Your browser does not support the audio element.
            </audio>
            <p>Looking forward to the future, I hope I can endure this academic-heavy quarter. I listed out most of my
                exams for
                this quarter, hoping to prepare for future tasks earlier and effectively.
